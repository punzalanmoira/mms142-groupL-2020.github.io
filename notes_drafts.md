## Notes
### [AP](/mms142-groupL-2020.github.io/about) \<Notes\>
([my notes focus more on the use of other online platforms like socmed rather than online sites](#comments))
disruptive technology or innovation: Online news sites and their innovative use of social media to deliver content. It is a disruptive technology or innovation because
1. It makes use of the Internet and online platforms to deliver content in forms that diverge from tradition
2. It uses social media in a way that it was not originally designed for because its nature suited the delivery of a particular news event; it repurposed social media and gave it a different use. For example, local events and disasters are covered real-time and uninterrupted by news reporters as live updates on Twitter, or streamed live on Facebook and YouTube. Unlike how delivery of the same ongoing events or breaking news are broadcasted intermittently through television and radio news.
3. This creative use of technology to deliver news in supplement to the News providers’ websites disrupt the news broadcasting networks and publishing industries alike.
News providers today utilize online streaming platforms and social media to deliver news to the public. Newscasters can cover an event on-site uninterrupted in real-time with the use of social media platforms such as Twitter and YouTube Live. Majority of today's generation of Information Age rely heavily on online social networking platforms to discover and research more about local and international events. The rise in the use of online platforms to deliver content threatens the necessity of publishing companies and decreases viewership of broadcasting networks.

Addition and opinion on Janelle's note (the passages is marked)[[1]](#makes-possible-one-or-more-new-technologies-processes-or-applications)[[2]](#alters-the-rate-of-change-of-a-technical-development): I agree, however, I think the demographic gap is also caused by the gap in technological literacy, and usability or accessibility.

For example, it is easy for the younger generation to find the topics they are interested in without getting lost or confused by the endless hyperlinks and ads. Meanwhile, the older generation, while many are learning to adapt to the latest technology, majority will still not be as savvy in navigating their way through endless articles, headlines and advertisements. The disabilities that people inevitably incur due to old age (e.g., poor vision, loss of color vision (color blindness), loss of hand motor control, etc.) also hinder the oldest generation to migrate to the innovative delivery of news. I think as people age and it becomes harder for them to read small texts from small screens and navigate their way through the maze of the Internet, they become more reliant on the traditional news delivery. Therefore, despite the disruptive impact today's innovative news delivery caused to the pre-existing news media industry, it is unlikely that it will eradicate their existence as they will remain as necessity to people in the long run. Newspaper outlets and publishers will still survive as they provide information to the less privileged areas, unless telecommunications companies successfully expand and improve their coverage that even the most remote areas are provided with adequate internet connection and communication services.

On the other hand, today's technology has also impacted local and international cable TV providers and television stations or networks as everything has become available online at a cheaper price and with more convenience and portability.

(My research gives support to [AP's notes](#ap-notes). Its focuses on Online News on Social Media)

Assessing technology if it’s disruptive we need to look into its nature.

#### Impactful and affects other technologies
- Immediate availability of news on social media or online as a whole shatters the competitive nature of traditional media which are not followed anymore
- Social Media News (Also, Online news in general) normalizes the distribution of the information which was formerly distributed by traditional media.

#### Makes Possible one or more new technologies, processes, or applications.
- Social media has the capabilities that enable users to gather information, build communities, and actively interact with old or recent news.
- Making news contents are changing. Offers a user/reader/listener focused news contents such as comments, videos, and etc.
- Suits different preferences of users. The capability of having access to news and socializing with other people on a single platform at the same time satisfies a lot of users making it successful.

#### Alters the rate of change of a technical development
(The following study in this section is found in one of my sources)

Reuters Institute Digital News Report study shows that:
- Among 26 countries, half of the total sample use social media to access news every week.
- Increasing users that consume news through social media, portals, and apps point out that traditional media brands continue to have a decreasing presence.
- Traditional Media is still popular to the older demographic but the usage is declining. Younger generations and other users prefer to set a particular time in their liking to view content such as news.
- Usage of smartphones are getting higher and reaching half of Reuter Institutes’ sample. Computer usage is dwindling while tablet usage is stable.
- Companies such as *BuzzFeed* are branching out their reach but they are still being used as secondary sources of news and topics. Media companies that built their reputation and trust to the public still remain the main sources.

#### Modifies existing technologies, allows interest to cross a critical threshold.
- Providing feedback is an important role after releasing news content, especially in social media to encourage engagement which traditional media fails to do.
- Political news which has some limits on what traditional news can deliver doesn’t exist in Social media news. Political news garners a lot of attention online especially on social media where engagement and feedback are permitted.
- Users are also able to continue their discussion to other related news.

#### Replacing existing technologies (faster, lower cost, convenient, or offers better performance)
- If a user has access to the internet, immediate access to a vast amount of news is free and globally available 24/7 which Social media sites offer.
- Payment to access any forms of traditional news are no more.

#### Technology that enables what has seemed impossible to do.
- Social media connected digital journalism (a combination of multimedia forms) and head-to-head discussion which allows users to communicate with one another and proceed to continuous conversations regarding different topics such as news.

(my notes are focused on the decline of the circulation of newspapers due to the presence of the internet; to be paraphrased later)
- The newsprint industry has experienced two disruptions due to innovation: the first was due to the advent of television in the 1950s then the second and seemingly fatal one is due to the advent of the internet. Because news nowadays can be widely and easily accessed through devices with an internet connection, a decline in readership led to a domino effect thereby resulting in a plummet in circulation, ad revenue and classified advertising. (Onikoyi, 2020).  
- In numbers gathered by the Pew Research Center in the US, newspaper circulation had its lowest decline in 2018 by 8% (about 28.6M) for weekdays and 9% (30.8M) for Sundays. A 62% decline in advertising revenue dwindled during the decade prior while “layoffs continue to pummel U.S. newspapers” as experienced in the same year by the 27% of news agencies with previous lucrative Sunday circulations. Despite all of this, most Americans (71%) were still under the impression that their local papers are still financially staying afloat even if only 14% of them supported the latter through subscriptions, membership and donations. (Grieco, 2020).
- Even before the advent of social media, newspapers were already going online. In a test trial in 1980, CompuServe dial-up service began working with at least 12 Associated Press member newspapers. The first newspaper to go online was The Columbus Dispatch on July 1, 1980. The other papers included were: The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Minneapolis Star Tribune, The San Francisco Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Times, The Virginian-Pilot / Ledger Star, The Middlesex News, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The CompuServe/AP online test trial ended in 1982.

### When did the massive shift from newspapers to social media happened?
(By MDr)

As to when exactly did the massive shift from newspapers to social media happened we can't be so sure.

We can say it started in the 80s, when people started going online on chat rooms, or Internet relay chats (IRC).

Also in the 80s, computers were becoming more affordable and thus common. It was only naturally that social media became more sophisticated too.

One social media site made in 1997, called Six Degrees enabled users to upload a profile and make friends with other people. It paved the way for microblogging and the social media we know today. And in 1999 as the first blogging sites became popular, it created a way for people "bloggers" or even companies to post about the sentiments, commentaries about social issues and even for news sites to publish content.

### Covid Pandemic Forcing News Companies to shift to New Media asap (social media/online)
(By MDr)

The Covid Pandemic has caused a lot of upheavals in how people/companies work or do business.

Since people weren't allowed to go out for a few months, people and companies were forced to adapt by going online.

People who usually watched TV, and were sick and tired of being bombarded with bad news preferred to go on Facebook instead. I know I was one. For respite from seemingly bad news about the Pandemic I decided to go online instead. There I found different views and opinions about the Pandemic. Various people doing "challenges" to safeguard their mental health.

And that's part of the beauty and charm of social media that newspapers lack. It's a one-sided experience that ends when one finishes reading. Whereas with online news sites with an area for comments, one is able to see what others think of the news, share views, and even get into an argument with a stranger.

And so I do believe that more and more news sites will go online, but I do not believe that all will succeed.
