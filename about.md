It’s easier to assign roles based on what each member is capable of doing at the moment, so the first section of this Wiki is the About Us Page with the name + role (ex. **FULL NAME (student number)** = research and coding) of each member listed:

| Member                                          | Skills |
|:---:|:---:|
| **PILE, KELSEY TIMMERIE V. (2019-30483)**       | organize, write, and beta (i can help in designing the website although I’m still new to GitHub; don't know how to code) |
| **DI ROCCO, MAJELLA P. (2013-81801)**           | research and writing. Not familiar with GitHub yet. Very little coding experience.                                       |
| **PROTUSADA, JANELLE MICA O. (2017-31124)**     | Research: I’m a very fast reader and likes to take notes. Can help in organization if needed. Not familiar with GitHub but open to learning it. |
| **PIL, APRIL ROSE B. (2014-67661)**             | my forte is in coding (although I'm not that skilled or advanced at it); I know how to code with HTML and CSS. I'm weak at research and writing but I'll still try contributing to our research notes. I've never used GitHub before, but I've visited the site occasionally before because of app installations and such. |
| **RADIN, MARJORIE IVANA MARIE C. (2017-30833)** | research and writing. I’m not really good in coding. First time to use Github. |
| **QUILARIO, JEREMY (2015-10259)**               | not that knowledgeable when it comes to coding, but I have done quite a few related projects in the past. Though I lack knowledge and practice, I understand the concept of coding with HTML and CSS, and I think I will be able to get the hang of it.  |
| **PUNZALAN, MOIRA (2019-01275)**                | I will really do my best to do whatever tasks given especially about writing and research stuff, also amateur editing and coding. |
