The innovative shift from physical hand-held newspapers to online does not go without criticism. In this report, we discuss how the online distribution of news through online sites, with additional mention to social media, is now a new and common means for how publishers disseminate information to the public, and how these people receive them. We iterate online news sites as one of the many examples of disruptive technology but first and foremost: What is Disruptive Technology?

Coined in 1995 by Christensen (Moore, 2019), disruptive technologies are innovations that displace incumbent establishments by creating a new market, having walked from the ground up. From the name itself, they are to disrupt the current market in ways that completely change the current giants. In terms of how establishments allow for them to be overthrown by rookie innovations, it all comes down to how most pitched innovations are not being taken seriously by the big heads, and thus see no competition or rivalry between present working innovations over unstable and unclear ideas.

To relate this to the innovation we have chosen, online news sites, we must first dive into its predecessor, newspapers.

According to Onikoyi (2020), the industry has already gone through the experience of disruptors with the invention of the television in the 1950s and the internet. They note that the newspaper industry's decline has "led to a domino effect thereby resulting in a plummet in circulation, ad revenue and classified advertising" (2020). With newspaper circulation in the US having its lowest decline by weekdays with 8%, and Sundays with 9%, ad revenue with 68%, and only 14% Americans having kept subscribed, and donated to these news agencies over the 71% claiming that "local papers are still financially staying afloat" (Grieco, 2020).

From the disruptor's arrival, newspapers were already going electronic according to Deseret News and St. Petersburg Times (1980). In a test trial in 1980, CompuServe dial-up service, and at the time a national computing service, began working with at least 11 Associated Press member newspapers. The first newspaper was The Columbus Dispatch on July 1, 1980. The other papers included were: The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Minneapolis Star Tribune, The San Francisco Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Times, The Virginian-Pilot / Ledger Star, The Middlesex News, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The CompuServe/AP online test trial ended in 1982. How the electronic delivery service worked was that it starts by placing a local call which will then be answered by a part of the service's nationwide packet-switching network, that then reaches the main database system.

As to when the shift from local papers to online started, both as online sites and then in cooperation with social media, it could have roughly started in the 80s, when people started going online on chat rooms, or Internet relay chats (IRC). This assumption follows the reasoning that in the same year, computers were becoming more affordable and thus common. It was only natural that the dissemination of information online as well as with social media became more sophisticated through the years. One social media site made in 1997, called Six Degrees, paved the way for microblogging and the social media we know today. And in 1999 as the first blogging sites became popular, it created a way for people "bloggers" or even companies to post about the sentiments, commentaries about social issues, and even for news sites to publish content.

In these findings, we discover the rough origins as well as how the traditional way of distributing information changed because of the internet, and generally onto what bloomed within it. Newspaper agencies had to adapt to the changing market, seeing as sustaining and continuing their publishing of physical papers were not to last long; or became at least the medium in which only a few would still come around for.

Online news sites are a prime example of disruptive technology as it completely changed how the industry approaches its consumers. First and foremost, it takes advantage of the internet’s accessibility towards a global audience, as well as online platforms, which strays far away from the traditional door-to-door delivery of information. Second, news providers have repurposed the original use of social media, whereby it was originally intended for socializing, news sites have added onto the platform with meaningful and real-time events interacting with regular users of the applications. The more common they are seen on people’s feeds, the more knowledgeable and able to be involved the people become. Third, with its rise in relevance and being normalized as an everyday online encounter, it disrupts traditional broadcasting networks and publishing industries from producing and covering news.

Online news sites and news in social media makes use of multimedia and allows users to communicate with one another and proceed to continuous conversations regarding different topics such as news. It brought portability and convenience for consumers: being able to access any article of news from anywhere around the globe, and even find a means to translate it, with just a click and/or swipe, to immediately search and find specific and available information from a simple keyword on a search engine, as well as have the opportunity to interact and engage with the content. Social media for example has connected digital journalism (a combination of multimedia forms) and head-to-head discussion from netizens and the writers themselves. The use of the internet in news distribution has also allowed a smarter and more effective usage of the news agencies’ budget.

Provided that we are living in the information age, rely on the internet specifically on online social networking platforms to discover and research more about local international events. According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report (Donoghue, 2016), 26 countries, half of the total sample use social media to access news every week. This is then supported by the following:
- Increasing users that consume news through social media, portals, and apps point out that traditional media brands continue to have a decreasing presence.
- Traditional Media is still popular to the older demographic but the usage is declining. Younger generations and other users prefer to set a particular time in their liking to view content such as news.
- Usage of smartphones is getting higher and reaching half of Reuter Institutes’ sample. Computer usage is dwindling while tablet usage is stable.

To note, news coverage will still be distributed through physical and televised means, and despite its disruptive impact as new markets and approaches have occurred because of it, there will still be consumers who would still rely on the traditional, seeing as there is still a gap in technological literacy, usability, and accessibility. As society progresses at an exponential rate as new inventions arise, human beings are still so far from catching up and completely eradicating the old. Until society solves the digital divide, the issues within less privileged areas, and the worries of those unable to adapt or view things from an LED screen, there will still be much to change before fully committing to the online distribution of news alone. That is of course unless telecommunications companies successfully expand and improve their coverage that even the most remote areas are provided with adequate internet connection and communication services, as well as create and heed to the concerns of the older generations and of people with disabilities to innovate and create platforms wherein information is accessible and safe for its consumers of all categories.

In conclusion, as newspapers dwindle in popularity as new generations breed off of online platforms and the internet, the industry must follow suit towards a new method in providing and distributing information to the public, which has even remarkably improved on a global scale. Online news sites and social media are just the beginning innovations that will pioneer the forthcoming ideas that would want to combat existing markets and to successfully build and alter the rate of change of technical development that appeals to the changing society and times. As disruptive as it is as an innovation, online news sites and social media have become increasingly more relevant and useful for the public than it did during news’ providers gradual migration to electronic then to digital.
